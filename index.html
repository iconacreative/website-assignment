  <p>
    Over the last 14 years, I've devoted my career to the creation and implementation of graphic design, most recently providing design solutions at Starbucks with a focus on in-store promotions. Before then, I spent years designing for agencies such as FITCH Seattle and Foundation Design.As a designer, I was responsible for the conceptualization, art direction and execution of graphic communication, design and strategy as they related to print assignments and the needs of our clients.
